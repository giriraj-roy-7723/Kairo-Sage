This project demonstrates an agentic AI pipeline that transforms a natural language user prompt into a fully functional software project. It uses LangGraph to orchestrate three specialized agents â€” Planner, Architect, and Coder â€” which collaborate to generate project files inside a sandboxed folder.

ðŸš€ Features

Planner Agent â†’ Converts user requests into a structured engineering project plan.

Architect Agent â†’ Breaks the plan into step-by-step, file-specific implementation tasks.

Coder Agent â†’ Iteratively executes tasks, writing project files using safe file tools.

Safe File Handling â†’ All generated code is stored inside generated_project/, with path checks to prevent unsafe writes.

Extensible Design â†’ Built with LangGraph and Pydantic for structured, modular development.
